<h1 id="Introduction"><a href="#Introduction" class="headerlink" title="Introduction"></a>Introduction</h1><p>In the previous <a href="/2021/07/29/strings/index.html">post</a> about strings, I discussed a few different approaches for storing and representing strings. Overall, the results of the custom string containers were only marginally better than std::string, but that was without any code optimizations! </p>
<p>One topic that was touched on in the last post, but was not fully explored was small string optimizations. The custom string implementation did accommodate small strings by allocating them on the stack, but I am going to attempt to improve on this design.</p>
<p>The implementation discussed in this post is based on the testing done in this <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://shaharmike.com/cpp/std-string/">blog post</a>.</p>
<h1 id="Current-Implementation"><a href="#Current-Implementation" class="headerlink" title="Current Implementation"></a>Current Implementation</h1><p>Previously, strings less than 12 bytes were placed on the stack, otherwise the string was heap allocated.</p>
<figure class="highlight c"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br><span class="line">5</span><br><span class="line">6</span><br><span class="line">7</span><br><span class="line">8</span><br><span class="line">9</span><br><span class="line">10</span><br><span class="line">11</span><br><span class="line">12</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line"><span class="class"><span class="keyword">union</span> <span class="title">string</span> </span></span><br><span class="line"><span class="class">&#123;</span></span><br><span class="line">    <span class="class"><span class="keyword">struct</span> &#123;</span></span><br><span class="line">        <span class="keyword">char</span> sptr[<span class="number">12</span>];</span><br><span class="line">        u32  len;</span><br><span class="line">    &#125;;</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">    <span class="class"><span class="keyword">struct</span> &#123;</span></span><br><span class="line">        <span class="keyword">char</span> *hptr;</span><br><span class="line">        u32   heap_size;</span><br><span class="line">    &#125;;</span><br><span class="line">&#125;;</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>

<p>Using a union for the container allows for the memory to be aliased within the struct. When memory is aliased between the stack and heap allocations, the total size of the structure is 16 bytes.</p>
<p><img src="/images/small_strings/AliasedString.png"></p>
<h1 id="Stack-Allocation"><a href="#Stack-Allocation" class="headerlink" title="Stack Allocation"></a>Stack Allocation</h1><p>The first change that will be made to the struct is to make the size of the stack allocation 16 bytes. I have two reasons for doing this:</p>
<ol>
<li>An additional 4 characters can be stored on the stack</li>
<li>Allows for the storage alignment to be 8 bytes instead of 4.</li>
</ol>
<p>The following shows the byte representation of the string container, where the last 8 bytes are omitted.<br><img src="/images/small_strings/AliasedString2.png"></p>
<h1 id="Null-Terminator"><a href="#Null-Terminator" class="headerlink" title="Null Terminator"></a>Null Terminator</h1><p>In the previous blog post, I demonstrated two approaches for placing the null terminator in the stack allocated string.</p>
<ol>
<li>Embed the null terminator in the stack . Reduces small strings to 15 chars.</li>
<li>Embed the null terminator in the size field.</li>
</ol>
<p>The first approach is obviously not what I want since it reduces the size of the stack allocated string, so the second approach is what I am going to improve. </p>
<p>To make things clearer, a max length small string (16 chars) will have the following memory layout for the length field.</p>
<p><img src="/images/small_strings/Length16.png"></p>
<p>In order to store a value of 16 for the length, only 1 of 8 bytes is actually needed! With a small adjustment, we are able to place the null terminator in the first unused byte of the length field.</p>
<p><img src="/images/small_strings/Length16Null.png"></p>
<h1 id="Squeezing-the-Length-Field-for-All-its-Worth"><a href="#Squeezing-the-Length-Field-for-All-its-Worth" class="headerlink" title="Squeezing the Length Field for All its Worth"></a>Squeezing the Length Field for All its Worth</h1><p>Awesome, we are now able to store all 16 bytes on the stack, but we can do better! There are still 6 unused bytes! By pretending the stack allocation extends out those 6 bytes, we are able to store up to 22 characters on the stack! </p>
<p><img src="/images/small_strings/Length22Pad.png"></p>
<p>You know what I think? I think it’s a shame that the null terminator has to take up one of those precious bytes! For any string less than 22 bytes, the null terminator fits nicely into whatever byte it needs to without an issue, but what if we wanted to sneak in an extra byte for a string of length 23?</p>
<p>It would be awfully convenient for the length byte to act as the null terminator for max length strings. In order to achieve this, rather than storing the length, store <code>23 - length</code>. That way, at max length, the stored value will be 0 and will act as the null terminator! In any other condition, the null terminator will be placed in the byte after the string.</p>
<p>Consider two scenarios. First, a string with a length of 20.</p>
<p><img src="/images/small_strings/Length20.png"></p>
<p>Length is stored as three (23 - 20 = 3), while the null terminator is placed in the fourth byte. Now, consider a max length string of 23 bytes.</p>
<p><img src="/images/small_strings/Length23.png"></p>
<p>Since length is stored as zero (23 - 23 = 0), the final byte acts as the null terminator!</p>
<h1 id="New-String-Container"><a href="#New-String-Container" class="headerlink" title="New String Container"></a>New String Container</h1><p>Before continuing, I want to show the new string container, so that we can keep it in mind for the next few optimizations.</p>

<p>Not much has actually changed for the container. <code>sptr</code> is now an array of 16 and storage is a 64bit number.  </p>
<h1 id="Heap-Flag"><a href="#Heap-Flag" class="headerlink" title="Heap Flag"></a>Heap Flag</h1><p>It is important to be able to determine whether or not the string is a small or large string. Prior to this implementation, a single bit was used within the length field as a heap flag for this distinction. However, with only 8 bits reserved for the length in small strings, this gets a little tricky.</p>
<p>The solution is to double the stored length for small strings, so that the bottomost bit is always 0.<br><code>Stored Length = 2 * (23 - length)</code></p>
<p>Below are two examples. In both cases, the bottommost bit is set to zero.</p>
<p>Length = 3 </p>
<p><img src="/images/small_strings/BitLength3.png"></p>
<ul>
<li>A length of 3 is stored as 40. (2 * (23 - 3) = 40)</li>
</ul>
<p>Length = 22</p>
<p><img src="/images/small_strings/BitLength22.png"></p>
<ul>
<li>A length of 22 is stored as 2. (2 * (23 - 22) = 2)</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="Storage-Field"><a href="#Storage-Field" class="headerlink" title="Storage Field"></a>Storage Field</h1><p>Traditionally, this field represents the heap capacity when the string is larger than 23 bytes. Based on the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kPR8h4-qZdk">talk</a> by Nicholas Ormrod about strings, I realized that my internal allocator aligns all allocations to 8 bytes! This means that all string heap allocations will have the three bottom set to zero. In the spirit of using all of the bits, these three bits can be used as flag bits. One bit is always reserved for the heap flag.</p>
<p>For example, here is a storage field, whose requested size was 50, but due to alignment, the actual allocation is 56.</p>
<p><img src="/images/small_strings/BitLength50.png"></p>
<h1 id="Optimizing-Storage-Field-for-Hashing"><a href="#Optimizing-Storage-Field-for-Hashing" class="headerlink" title="Optimizing Storage Field for Hashing"></a>Optimizing Storage Field for Hashing</h1><p>In the string pool, the storage field is used to cache the hashed string instead of the heap capacity. There is no alignment with the hashing algorithm, so if I want the bottom three bits as flag bits, I have to reserve them manually.</p>
<p>On large string initialization, this field is set to zero and an extra flag bit is used to mark the field as “dirty”. Anytime a user wants to compare strings and the dirty bit is set, the string is hashed and its value stored. When the dirty bit is not set, the hash is used to compare the strings. This is a small optimization so that string data does not have to be fetched from memory each time we want to compare strings.</p>
<p>For small strings, the hash is not cached since the hashing algorithm is fast enough to not incur a significant cost (at least in release builds). The string is also stored on the stack, which does not result in a memory fetch when hashing the string.</p>
<h1 id="Heap-Allocations"><a href="#Heap-Allocations" class="headerlink" title="Heap Allocations"></a>Heap Allocations</h1><p>The final bit of the string container needs to be the heap flag, so for large strings, where the flag bits are stored with the capacity/hash value, need to swap the capacity/hash value with the length. The length of the string is stored within the storage field and the capacity/hash value is stored in the length field.</p>
<h1 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h1><p>In this post I demonstrated how a string container can store up to 23 characters on the stack. I also showed how a user could optimize for string comparisons by caching the hashed string if they do not need the heap capacity. </p>
<p>For more information, I highly recommend watching the talk by Nicholas Ormrod! He does a great job explaining Facebook’s string implementation and the talk is only 30 minutes.</p>
<p>Until next time,<br>Dustin Hollar</p>
